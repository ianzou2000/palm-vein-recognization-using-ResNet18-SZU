# palm-vein-recognization-using-ResNet18-SZU

This is my class project for Machine Learning at SZU in 2022 fall.

It's to use pre-trained ResNet-18 to first solve a classification problem for different palm veins, then the well-trained model will be used to determine whether the palm veins come from the same person given two images. The final correct rate of the matching task is 91%, ranking 2 in 40 in my class.

No dataset can be offered.
